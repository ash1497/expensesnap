# Expense Snap

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application that takes Receipt images and extracts all relevant information and displays it in an excel format. Note that this is the front end, the actual processing happens in the backend structure. 

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
